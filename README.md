# payload
Goal of this project is to create a keylogger file in .exe, then deliver it to target's computer via BADUSB (in my case im using ATmega32u4 chip AKA arduino leonardo). Kelogger itself is yet to be fully completed however assume any  files other than README in this repo are keyloggers or some other malware so tread carefully!...
